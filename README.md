# DSA_210_Project

## Motivation 
I go to gym regularly and my performance may differ day from day. I always wonder what factors affect the performance. Of course I know eating, sleep affects but I wonder whether the music genre affects it or not. I use an app that saves the data of my workout details (eg. the weight that I lifted, the total volume of workout, the length of workout) named Hevy. The aim of the project is gain insights about how the music affects my performance and optimize my workout performance by listening proper music.

## Datasets

I will have two datasets. The first one is Hevy, I mentioned about it above. I will use the weight that I lifted and compare the workouts. The second one is Spotify. I will use the data restricted in workout times. I will collect the songs and their genres.

## Plan

I have a question and a clear purpose. So I know what data I should gather for my project. I am going to collect the datas, and ensure that datasets are reliable. After that, I'm going to clean the data(eg. perform necessary data type conversions...). After, I am going to conduct EDA, examine the statistical distribution, relationships, and general characteristics of the data, use visualization tools to identify trends, outliers, and patterns (e.g., histograms, scatter plots). Then, statistical models or machine learning algorithms going to be developed based on the analysis goals. Finally, I will have my results I achieved through data analysis, so I am planning to report my results.
